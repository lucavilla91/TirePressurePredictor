# Tire Pressure Predictor

A professional tool for GT and Formula racing that predicts optimal cold tire pressures to achieve target hot pressures during a stint.

## Overview

Tire Pressure Predictor uses a machine learning model trained on real championship telemetry data to predict the cold tire pressures needed to reach your target hot pressures after a specified number of laps.

Instead of relying on trial-and-error or simplified linear formulas, this tool provides data-driven predictions based on actual racing conditions.

## Features

- **ML-based predictions** - Trained on real GT and Formula telemetry data for accurate results
- **Track-specific analysis** - Accounts for track characteristics and tire behavior
- **Pressure trend visualization** - Charts showing pressure evolution over laps
- **Auto track detection** - Uses GPS to automatically select the nearest circuit
- **Race Simulation mode** - Plan your full race tire strategy across multiple stints, accounting for fuel load changes and tire degradation
- **NO TPMS mode** - For vehicles without Tire Pressure Monitoring System, get predictions without real-time sensor feedback
- **Custom track support** - Add tracks not in the database with scaling coefficients
- **Thermal correction tables** - Fine-tune predictions based on ambient conditions
