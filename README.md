# Tire Pressure Predictor

A professional tool for racing passionates that predicts optimal cold tire pressures to achieve target hot pressures during a stint.

## Overview

Tire Pressure Predictor uses a ML model trained on real telemetry data to predict the cold tire pressures needed to reach your target hot pressures after a specified number of laps in a specific track.

Instead of relying on trial-and-error or simplified linear formulas, this tool provides data-driven predictions based on previous data.

## Features

- **ML-based predictions** - Trained on real telemetry data for accurate results
- **Multi-software** - Import data from all telemetry softwares: Motec/WinDarab/WinTAX etc
- **Track-specific analysis** - Accounts for track characteristics
- **Pressure trend visualization** - Charts showing pressure evolution over laps
- **Auto track detection** - Uses GPS to automatically select the nearest circuit
- **Race Simulation mode** - Suggests the bleed to adopt after formation laps based on hystoric runs
- **NO TPMS mode** - For vehicles without Tire Pressure Monitoring System, get predictions with input-output simplified model
- **Custom track support** - Add tracks not in the database with scaling coefficients based on tracks similarity
- **Thermal correction tables** - Fine-tune predictions based on ambient conditions

## System Requirements
